# Python Based Web Crawler

Developed a web crawler using Python for systematic website content indexing, recursively parsing HTML pages, ensuring comprehensive data extraction and structured organization for insightful analysis

Enhanced the project by customizing the output to provide detailed information at each recursion level, including the total number of files, and segregating them by types such as HTML, CSS, JPG, and JS

Enhanced user interaction by incorporating command line arguments to specify the website link, recursion threshold, type of segregation and output file, thereby improving the overall usability of the web crawler
